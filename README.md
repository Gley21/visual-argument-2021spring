Philosophy is important to me and not just because I find it interesting.
It has really taught me how to think differently about the things we sometimes
take for granted. It has allowed me to explore old ideas in new and exciting
ways. It has prompted me to ask some big questions about my life and how I
should act. I think that these are all really important things that
philosophy has shown me and so I wanted to make something to encourage people
to free their minds and look into philosophy!

I hope that my visual collage (and the philosokey pun) can help get the idea
out there that philosophy is a worthy pursuit and offers a way to help you
learn to think outside the box. As the title suggests, with philosophy you
finally get a change to "Free Your Mind."
